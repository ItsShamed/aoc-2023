# Advent of Code 2023

This is my take of the Advent of Code Edition 2023, do not expect code quality
nor performance here.

You can see it as how it would look if it was given as a C assignment to an EPITA
student.

This repo tries to apply EPITA's coding style as much as I can (blindly because
I don't have the time to compile my own version of clang-tidy).
